## üéÆ Retro Gaming Console with Raspberry Pi 4

A **Raspberry Pi 4** was used to create a **retro gaming console** using **Batocera**. This allows users to enjoy classic games from various consoles in a single, easy-to-use interface, demonstrating the Raspberry Pi's versatility as an entertainment device.

---

## üöÄ Exhibition Features

- **Automated Demos**: Seamlessly demonstrate Linux distributions (Kali, Ubuntu, Fedora, Raspberry Pi) using SSH automation.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor demo status with a dynamic progress bar.
- **Clean and Simple GUI**: Built with **Tkinter** (Python) and **JavaFX** (Java) for a user-friendly interface.
- **Exhibition Logs**: Real-time logs and error outputs displayed in the app.
- **Educational Focus**: Highlights the MSc CS (Data Analysis) batch's automation and data analysis skills.

## üß∞ Key Technologies

- **Python**: Core automation logic
- **Java**: Additional functionality, built with Maven
- **Tkinter**: Python GUI
- **JavaFX**: Java GUI
- **paramiko**: SSH automation in Python
- **Maven**: Java build management
- **Linux Distributions**: Kali, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the `distributions` dictionary in `pi_and_penguin.py` to set SSH credentials and commands:

```python
distributions = {
    "Kali Linux": {"host": "192.168.1.101", "user": "user1", "password": "password1", "command": "kali-demo-command"},
    "Ubuntu": {"host": "192.168.1.102", "user": "user2", "password": "password2", "command": "ubuntu-demo-command"},
    # Add more distributions as required...
    "Raspberry Pi": {"host": "192.168.1.103", "user": "pi", "password": "raspberry", "command": "pi-demo-command"}
}
```

For Java, configure SSH and commands in the Java application as needed.
