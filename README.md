> **An automated exhibition system created for the NAAC visit by the MSc CS (Data Analysis) batch at BVM Holy Cross College, Cherpunkal, managed by Alan Cyril Sunny.**

### üìÖ **Event:** NAAC Accreditation Visit  
### üìç **Venue:** BVM Holy Cross College, Cherpunkal  
### üë®‚Äçüíª **Handled by:** Alan Cyril Sunny (MSc CS, Data Analysis Batch)

## üìú **Overview**

This project, **Pi and Penguin - Exhibition Automation**, was specially crafted for the NAAC accreditation visit. It demonstrates various Linux distributions and Raspberry Pi in an automated manner using a graphical interface. The project showcases the technical expertise and project management capabilities of the MSc CS (Data Analysis) batch, with a focus on automation, system integration, and real-time feedback.

## üöÄ **Exhibition Features**

- **Automated Demos**: Seamlessly demonstrate Linux distributions such as Kali, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Raspberry Pi using SSH automation.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor the status of each demo through a dynamic progress bar.
- **Clean and Simple GUI**: Built using **Tkinter**, offering a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
- **Exhibition Logs**: Real-time logs of demo outputs and any errors, displayed directly in the app.
- **Educational Focus**: Highlights the data analysis and system automation capabilities of the MSc CS (Data Analysis) batch.

## üí° **Key Technologies**

- **Python**: Core programming language for the entire project.
- **Tkinter**: Used to design the graphical user interface.
- **paramiko**: SSH library for executing remote commands.
- **Linux Distributions**: Demos include Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, and more.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Integrated to demonstrate IoT and embedded systems projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**

1. **SSH Connections**: Connects to remote machines using SSH to run predefined commands for each Linux distribution or Raspberry Pi.
2. **Automated Demo Execution**: Executes commands on each system, such as launching scripts or showcasing features of the operating system.
3. **Live Log and Progress**: The output of each command and progress of the demonstration is displayed in real-time in the application‚Äôs GUI.
4. **Completion Notification**: When all demos are completed, the user receives a notification, ensuring a smooth exhibition flow.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Installation**

### **Pre-requisites**

- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Install required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install paramiko tkinter
  ```

### **Steps to Run the Project**

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/penguin-and-pi-exhibition.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd penguin-and-pi-exhibition
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python penguin_and_pi.py
   ```

4. **Begin the exhibition**: Click on **Start Exhibition** to begin automated demonstrations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

To add or modify the SSH credentials and commands for each Linux distribution or Raspberry Pi, edit the `distributions` dictionary in the `penguin_and_pi.py` file as shown below:

```python
distributions = {
    "Kali Linux": {"host": "192.168.1.101", "user": "user1", "password": "password1", "command": "kali-demo-command"},
    "Ubuntu": {"host": "192.168.1.102", "user": "user2", "password": "password2", "command": "ubuntu-demo-command"},
    # Add more distributions as required...
    "Raspberry Pi": {"host": "192.168.1.103", "user": "pi", "password": "raspberry", "command": "pi-demo-command"}
}
```
